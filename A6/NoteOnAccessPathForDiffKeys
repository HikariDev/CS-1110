ACCESS PATH to get the ACTUAL DATA from the DB,
    depending on what type of KEY is used . . .


To access by PK (country name)
- use name as key to access db
        >>> gets value: tuple of fields to write (plus name)

To access by a CK (country id or country code)
- for id:
    - use id as key to access id_index >>> gets value:  name
    - use name as key to access db
        >>> gets value:  tuple of fields to write (plus name)
- for code:
    - same as above, but use code_index

To access by an SK (cont)
- use cont as key to access cont_index >>> gets value:  LIST OF names
- loop through that list - use each name as key to access db
        >>> gets value: tuple of fields to write (plus name)

To access by a NON-key (pop) (with a > or < condition)
- go through entire db dictionary, getting the value part
    (tuple which includes pop)
    - check if condition True or False & either write the data or don't
